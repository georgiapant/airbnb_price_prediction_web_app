Hi , my name is Elpidoforos which can be translated from Greek as ""the one who bares hope. I  actually find it difficult to live up to the meaning of my name, but I really am doing my best. Most people just call me Doros for short - which, by the way, means ""gift"" or ""present"" in Greek. 

I was brought up in Athens and I have lived here, practically all my life. My studies in Sociology and Marketing, as well as my previous work experience - which included direct sales - provided me with a thorough understanding of social  behavior and how this is affected by cultural and other factors. 

I was working as a travel agent for seven years, mainly as an outgoing tour operator for Middle East countries - til 2011 when riots broke out in Syria, which was our main destination. I've been to Syria, Jordan and Lebanon more that 10 times as a tour leader and this was, without doubt  a very important experience in my life.

115,5044938,"I am from Athens, however I have very close ties with two beautiful Greek islands Santorini and Patmos.

As my father’s family is from Santorini I spent all my summers there. Since I am a licensed tour guide, in 2004 I decided to move to Santorini in order to work there. This was a great chance to start renovating my family’s properties in order to be able to share them with people from all over the world. 

In addition, many years ago, my mother visited the island of Patmos, fell in love with it and decided to buy two beautiful pieces of land, including very old farmhouses in ruinous condition, that she slowly renovated. In this way, our family and numerous friends enjoyed many unforgettable Patmos Easters and summers. Nowadays, I am responsible for the good condition of the houses that I rent out and share the beauty and special ambiance of this island with our guests.

I am very lucky since my twin daughters, Alexandra and Christina, having completed their studies abroad in hospitality management and tourism, returned to their roots in order to continue and develop what I started.  Genuine hospitality, love and respect for the island, as well as the embracement of the local culture define our core values. Nowadays we all share our time between Santorini, Patmos and Athens, and have the honor and pleasure to share our family’s story and our love for these islands, with visitors from all over the world. 

After many years in the hospitality industry, today I have the pleasure along with my daughters to embrace one more much loved island home, my husband's summer house on the island of Hydra. The house was built by my father in law 40 years ago. My husband Dimitris will be managing the house in Hydra.

My name is Ignatios and I live at Ampelokipi-Goudi, a central area of Athens, my city of birth. 

I've studied foreign languages and literatures at the University of Trieste in Italy and my current occupation is foreign languages teaching. 

I like reading and taking long walks across the sea or in the mountain, especially in spring when green is at its best! 
Among many cities my favorite are Paris and Trieste, a city in north Italy where a spent a long period during my studies.

I like the mediterranean kitchen with its simple tastes enriched by the aromas of nature such as a plate of pasta al dente with crude vegetables and some fresh cheese with oregan on top.

While we were traveling to new places and meeting old friends / making new ones, we felt what a rental should feel like, what it should offer guests like ourselves. Lots were missing, especially the simple little things that makes a visitor feel right at home -away from home. We then decided to start a rentals & real estate management company. It was July 2015 and we named it TopHouzzing Properties - the mission was simply to offer truly top accommodation to our guests. Starting then with a couple of our own properties, refurbished completely, we embarked on a great journey. 

Today the company manages close to 100 properties and growing steadily, mostly in Athens but also in mainland Greece and islands, flats, villas and so on. TopHouzzing  also offers consulting & real estate, design & construction and other professional services in its portfolio.

Hard work and our passion paid off. Our success is clearly stated not only in the many owners that trust us with their properties but even more in the hundreds 5-star reviews from guests from all over the world,  leading us to have a record of 14 consecutive quarters-since the company’s inception- SuperHost status on Airbnb!

I ve been  host and traveler in Airbnb for about three and a half years now and we really enjoy what i do!
 Getting in touch with guests, interacting with people from all around the world, sharing stories were some of my first reasons we started hosting here!
After all the guests i have hosted we can say that being a host for someone means a lot and especially to us, greeks ,that we have the idea of hospitality  really high to our way of living! 
As a guest, its always nice to go somewhere and have someone to answer your questions and chat with them  instead of goin to a impersonal reception in a hotel lobby.
Airbnb is hard work and most of us who ve been here a long time know it really well!
 It’s a lot of work
Between the communication, setting up your spot, updating the cal, getting photos, laundry, cleaning, everything, it’s a lot of work. You typically don’t have a full time staff working for you, so this is all you most of the times. You are the business development team, the creative team, and most certainly the customer support team. If you do not perform at the highest level at each of these positions, you could see sales decrease. Thanks to the transparency of reviewing hosts and guests, if you mess up, everyone will know, and your business will suffer.
This is one of the reasons why I love Airbnb. You get rewarded for a job well done.",within an hour,95%,f,"['email', 'phone', 'facebook', 'reviews', 'manual_offline', 'offline_government_id', 'government_id']",4,f,t

Ζω και εργάζομαι από το 1989 στην Αθήνα την οποία αγαπάω πάρα πολύ και πιστεύω ότι όλοι οι άνθρωποι θα πρέπει να την επισκευτούν τουλάχιστον μία φορά στη ζωή τους. Πριν από το 1989 έζησα στην Κολωνία, στο Έσσεν, στις Βρυξέλλες, στο Παρίσι, στη Μαδρίτη, στη Μάλαγα. Ταξίδεψα στις Μαλδίβες, στην Σιγκαπούρη, στα Αραβικά Εμιτάτα, στην Αίγυπτο, στην Ταϊλάνδι, και σε πάρα πολλά ελληνικά νησιά.
Πιστεύω ότι τα ταξίδια, τα βιβλία, η μουσική, οι φίλοι και οι διανθρώπινες επαφές κάνουν την ζωή μας ομορφότερη! Χαίρομαι για τους ανθρώπους που μένει ακόμη να γνωρίσω. Δεν θα μπορούσα να ζήσω χωρίς τα ταξίδια, την μουσική, τα βιβλία, την αρχαία ελληνική τραγωδία και τα όνειρά μου! Τα αγαπημένα μου νησιά είναι η Σίφνος, η Πάτμος, η Λευκάδα, η Σκιάθος η Σκόπελος, η Πάρος και η Σαντορίνη. Το αγαπημένο μου βιβλίο είναι η Ασκητική του Νίκου Καζαντζάκη, ο αγαπημένος μου συνθέτης είναι ο Βίλα Λόμπος, η αγαπημένη μου ταινία είναι κάθε ταινία που μας κάνει καλύτερους και το αγαπημένο μου φαγητό είναι τα αιγαιοπελαγήτικα ψάρια με κάθε λογής χορταρικά, οι σαλάτες από την λατρεμένη ελληνική γη και το βιολογικό ελαιόλαδο της μαμάς μου. Καλή αντάμωση!",,,f,"['email', 'phone', 'reviews']",1,f,t

Whether it's a short or a long term stay, a house is a place which should provide comfort, security, and shelter for the hours we need to relax after a hard working (or maybe exciting as well) day.
A great house is more likely to provide a great experience; and that's what we aim for, especially when it comes to our holidays!

hope the voyage is a long one,
full of adventure, full of discovery.
Laistrygonians and Cyclops,
angry Poseidon—don’t be afraid of them:
you’ll never find things like that on your way
as long as you keep your thoughts raised high,
as long as a rare excitement
stirs your spirit and your body.
Laistrygonians and Cyclops,
wild Poseidon—you won’t encounter them
unless you bring them along inside your soul,
unless your soul sets them up in front of you.
 
Hope the voyage is a long one.
May there be many a summer morning when,
with what pleasure, what joy,
you come into harbors seen for the first time;
may you stop at Phoenician trading stations
to buy fine things,
mother of pearl and coral, amber and ebony,
sensual perfume of every kind—
as many sensual perfumes as you can;
and may you visit many Egyptian cities
to gather stores of knowledge from their scholars.
 
Keep Ithaka always in your mind.
Arriving there is what you are destined for.
But do not hurry the journey at all.
Better if it lasts for years,
so you are old by the time you reach the island,
wealthy with all you have gained on the way,
not expecting Ithaka to make you rich.
 
Ithaka gave you the marvelous journey.
Without her you would not have set out.
She has nothing left to give you now.
 
And if you find her poor, Ithaka won’t have fooled you.
Wise as you will have become, so full of experience,
you will have understood by then what these Ithakas mean.

It was very important for me to live in a house that could carry the aesthetics and the ambience of my homeland I was familiar (Website hidden by Airbnb) the Athenian appartment I chose, is right next to the ""Kallimarmaro"", the famous ancient marble stadium in the center of Athens, and the National Garden. Plaka area as well as the Acropolis Museum is just 10 minutes walk from my place! Even the sea I love, is not far...  less than 40  minutes ride by tram! My ideal home could not be complete without my pets, my books, my music and an amazing view to the Acropolis and Lycabettus hill, from my green roof garden! This is where I invite my best friends on summer nights , to enjoy a delicious dinner-I love to cook, traditional Mediterranean dishes!- and a glass of Greek wine, watching the Parthenon all lit up! You couldn't ask for more... don't you agree?
My favourite destination is... summer Athens by night, especially in my neighbourhood, one of the most beautiful locations in Athens .
My favourite writers are Marguerite Yurcenar and Jonathan Coe . My favourite film is ""Shortbus"" and all films directed by Woody Allen and Quentin Tarantino. I enjoy good music, no matter what genre it is, however jazz is what I love most. 
My motto is Mahatma Gandhi's "" be the change you want to see in the world""...

912,74823061,"My name is Eftihia (Eftehea), from the words 'ef' and 'tihi' (tehe) which mean 'good' and 'luck' in ancient greek. My name is also a noun. In modern greek the word eftihia means happiness. For ancient greeks happy was the fortunate one. Nowdays happy is the joyful one. My name is quite a heavy thing to go by everyday, as it means something so great and simple (but veeeery complicated too..), that it is sometimes a real struggle to deliver its meaning and idea and project in in your life. And other's lives around you.

My parents origins are from the Peloponese and Zakynthos (Ionian Island). But I grew up in the wider terretory of Attica Prefecture, in particular in 2 suberbs of Athens- Marousi and Kifisia.

My profession is acting and as that started as a career (B.C. - before Crisis!!!) but has practically ended up a practical hobby (A.C.- after Crisis..), I am trying to reinvent myself and my life and scetch a 'plan B'..

Whatever that will occur to be, my true passion is walking barefoot on sharp rocks of isolated greek islands. If I was from India I think they would say I used to be a wild goat in a previous life. My technique in this strange extreme sport is really something to admire. I love walking in general, I like nature and even though I am definately a child of the city, my soul meets its 'core' when away from it. It is like the purity of my existence absolutely relates to the inviroment I find myself in. The landscape of a mountain or a beach or a lake or a river automatically turns me into a better person. My effort has always been to manage to carry that person with me even in the packed and trafficy Streets and Avenues of Athens.

My favourite time of the day in the area I leave in (where my house that welcomes airbnb guests is located) is between 2-6 in the morning. When the city sleeps one is able to 'pick up' and fully absorb this area's true energy. When crowded it is just another touristic place with great historical interest. But its healing effect one can only get when it is (Website hidden by Airbnb) and (Website hidden by Airbnb) l.. At times of grief, pressure or distress I found that walking (AND jogging too!) around in that neighbourhood at these hours of the day was very therapeutic.

Sharing your house with people you don't know (and- at circummstances- you might actually never even meet!!!) became possible thanks to this whole airbnb notion that you created. It is a beautiful chain that connects people who wanted more- out of traveling- than a regular hotel or rudimantary furnished/equipped apartments. That chain allows travellers to make a 'subtour'  in their tour, experience how a person from a different country and culture lives. Like a quick whimsy eavesdropping or innocent peeping that might 'salt or sweeten up' the first and last moments of ones journey to a foreign place.

Philoxenia today is a generosity of spirit, a joyful kind of the best-of-what's-mine-is-yours attitude in which Greeks take pride as a defining attribute.
Philoxenia for me is as simple as a smile, or opening my home to guests making them feel like if it were theirs.

It’s a compound word from ""ΦΙΛΩ=LOVE"" and ""ΞΕΝΟΣ=GUEST "" and refers to the act of nestling and caring of a guest by the host. It was an institution for the ancient Greeks to welcome and take care of the guests at their home. They believed particularly in the idea of hospitality and regarded it as a moral duty and a sacred rule of the gods (Xenios Zeus was the protector of the guests). They offered them bath and sleep and they greeted them with gifts. The host and the guest were linked with friendly ties, which where inherited to their descendants.

What I enjoy most about Athens is the mix of culture, history, nightlife and the fact that every district of the city has its own 'soul'. 
But Exarcheia district, is my favour!. The most uncontrovercial and vibrant area in Athens. Thousents of alternative cafe, bars with all the types of music, open squads, galleries,
and of cource very very delicious traditional greek taverns and restaurands. Is a place with history,  for instance there is the Polytechnic University with the historical gate in the garden which the tank of the dictatorship flattened in 1973 to attack to the student movement fighting for the democracy.
There are pedestrian roads foul of the most famour graffities and political slogans, there is also, the Exsarcheia Square , a place which the wild youth of the city spend their time!

 I enjoy a good ""gledi"", motorcycle, swimming in the Greek Seas, Indian food, friends and time with my kids.
Γεια χαρά είμαι η Τζανάνι! Είμαι μητέρα δύο παιδιών και ζω στην Αθήνα.

Έτσι εδώ και τέσσερα χρόνια σπουδάζω στη Σχολή εικαστικών και εφαρμοσμένων τεχνών στο Αριστοτέλειο Πανεπιστήμιο Θεσσαλονίκης και νιώθω πραγματικά πως κάνω κάτι που με εκφράζει και μου δίνει ελευθερία.
Έχουμε κάνει πολλά και όμορφα ταξίδια στην Ελλάδα και στην Ευρώπη. Μου αρέσει να ανακαλύπτω καινούρια μέρη και διαφορετικούς πολιτισμούς και παραδόσεις. Η αλήθεια είναι πως δε γνωρίζαμε μέχρι πρόσφατα τη δυνατότητα να μείνουμε σε ένα διαμέρισμα αντί για ξενοδοχείο. Η αδελφή μου, που ταξίδεψε στην Ισπανία εξ αιτίας της δουλειάς της, μου είπε πως έμεινε σε ένα διαμέρισμα και γνώρισε καλύτερα τον τόπο, τους ανθρώπους και τις συνήθειες τους. Έτσι λοιπόν πήρα την απόφαση να διαθέσω το διαμέρισμά μου προς ενοικίαση και να βοηθήσω άλλους ανθρώπους να γνωρίσουν πραγματικά την Αθήνα και να νιώσουν σαν ένα κομμάτι της!
Θεωρώ πως στη ζωή πρέπει να δοκιμάζεις καινούρια πράγματα, να μαζεύεις εμπειρίες και να γνωρίζεις νέους ανθρώπους, με στόχο να γίνεσαι καλύτερος!
Το σλόγκαν που με αντιπροσωπεύει είναι:

About 20 years ago I decided to move on, follow my dreams and live in Greece. After many (really many) relocations I stranded in Athens where I live permanently since 2011 and now I'm calling this city my home.

What I specially like about Athens is that each neighborhood has its own character, like living in a totally different town. Furthermore, the mixture of culture, history and nightlife Athens has to offer makes it a full-year-worth-visiting location. Just wait until you take a walk on the historic street around the Acropolis, enjoy your meal or your drinks in so different and yet beautiful places, and then you'll know what I mean.

The best moments when I travel, besides seeing monuments etc, is when I have the opportunity to know better the locals. That always leads me to one conclusion: we are like a big family on this planet, so respecting each other and having honest and open communication is the key to being happy for me.

My name is Alexandros. I live in the suburbs of Athens but always enjoy to travel away of the city, especially to Kea. 
I am what you would call a tech savvy person. Graduated from the Computer Science Department of the University of Hertfordshire with a degree specializing in Digital Entertainment Systems (what I call artistic programming! it includes animation, game design and editing ). When i am not exploring the world of technology i like to spend quality time with friends and family. My hobbies include drawing (mostly pencil sketches of characters and scenery), basketball, tennis, wood work and (yes indeed) driving. 
I speak fluent English, unfortunately though i have forgotten most of the French language as i never had the chance to practice. Recently started to learn Serbian but i don’t think i can handle the accent ;)
I used to play the flute for 7 years in music school and obtained the highest degree when i was 16 but for some reason i have not played a lot since then.
As far as entertainment is concerned ,i appreciate all kinds of movies and series but my favourite themes are sci-fi and comedy. I follow most music genres with classic rock as a priority. 

I believe to be a welcoming person, always interested in meeting new people and exchanging ideas and experiences.

My moto in life is : everything will be fine as long as i can have my coffee in the morning.

I grew up in Athens, Greece and I decided to become a full-time Airbnb host in 2014 at the age of 28. Hospitality has always been something that I have been passionate about. I was in the music industry for many years. I hosted music events in Athens, which gave me the ability to easily interact with all types of people. Making the people around me feel good has become my core passion and purpose.

MY AIRBNB STORY 
2011 
I took a one way trip to Ibiza, Spain for self-discovery. I ended up spending 9 months on this beautiful Balearic island meeting awesome people, struggling, and working at the very well known Cafe Del Mar. Of course, this journey had its ups and downs. I'd be more than happy to describe them over coffee with you.

2012 
After Ibiza, I decided to forego the nightlife and focus on finishing my studies and accomplishing my mandatory Army duty in Greece.  

2014 
After finishing my studies in Computer Science, I ended up spending 6 months as a soldier in Cyprus.  The last 3 days before my departure back to Greece I took on the challenge to book an Airbnb for the very first time. My host, Nicolas, blew my mind with his extraordinary kindness and hospitality. As you can probably guess, that was my starting point for hosting.  

2014 UNTIL TODAY 
I have hosted more than 3,000 happy guests, shared beautiful human moments, gained financial freedom, traveled the world, became an official Airbnb public speaker, recruited and helped more than 40 new Airbnb hosts, and assisted more than 150 guests with unexpected travel issues (stolen passports, missed flights, etc).  

MY VISION 
I want to continue building my personal hospitality brand (withPanos), offer the best local experiences, create a well-being movement, share many Greek meals, travel the world, explore hospitality through kindness, and maybe one day become a proud father and spouse.  

INTERESTS 
My interests include: spiritual and personal development; running; biking; swimming; traditional Greek food; tea; gardening; reading/listening to books; taking care of my backyard wildlife; exploring the USA; and cooking (when I have the time to enjoy it). I am passionate about languages and learning. I am fluent in English and I am learning Spanish and German. I previously studied Computer Science. I am enthusiastic about human connection, listening to people’s stories, and spiritual connection. I am also passionate about dogs and nature.  

FAVORITE MUSIC, MOVIES & BOOKS 
I love music and enjoy anything from Classical to Funk, R&B, Motown, the Beatles, Classic Rock, Blues, Pop, New Age, Country, and just about anything, although I am not as well versed in Hip Hop.  Shawshank Redemption, West Side Story . . . there are so many movies I love; it just depends on my mood. I typically watch inspirational movies, true stories, documentaries, romance, dramas, period movies, martial arts, and animation. I prefer movies that are not overly violent. I have a sense of humor and loved the movie ""Under Cover Brother."" I like Tyler Perry movies.  I read a lot of spiritual, inspiration, and business books. I enjoy Pema Chodron and often refer to “The Power of Now” by Eckhart Tolle. I recently read ""The Surrender Experiment,” “The Glass Castle,” and “Your Brain at Work."" I listen to audiobooks constantly which is how I get through so many books so quickly.  

COUNTRIES I'VE VISITED 
United States, Canada, UK, France, Portugal, Spain, Italy, Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, Sweeden, Poland, Bulgaria, Romania.  

TRAVELING STYLE & HOSTING 
I am an adventurous traveler. I prefer to do and see things the locals enjoy. I prefer not to travel in groups or take cruises. I can be flexible and enjoy a range of accommodations and meals, but in general I like to keep things simple.  As a host, however, I enjoy guests who love to interact with the locals. I always make sure they feel well cared for — even spoiled. My guests enjoy my fun approach to life, as well as my interactive blackboards and world maps. I have always been complimented on my eye for detail and my desire to make even the ordinary feel special.  From the lovely views, peaceful settings, and friendly outdoor animal visitors, to the manner in which I go out of my way to make things unique and fulfill guest requests, you can count on having a positive stay and looking forward to a return visit to our beloved homes in exciting Athens.",within an hour,97%,f,"['email', 'phone', 'facebook', 'google', 'reviews', 'offline_government_id', 'selfie', 'government_id', 'identity_manual']",8,t,t

Dear Airbnb Community, 

My husband and I will be very happy to meet all of you. 

I was born in United States and recently we relocated in Southern Greece. The best decision I ever made :) We're very social and friendly. I love nature and I have several interests and hobbies. I enjoy the healthy food and I love to cook traditional Greek cuisine; I make my own olives, pies, pizza and marmalades, using only organic ingredients from our garden and other co-op local farms. If you're lucky you could taste my famous ""SPANAKOPITA"" (spinach pie) :-) 

To my Messinia guests I offer the possibility to book a day trip with us, a wine-tasting, a private dinner or a cooking class. When you arrive we can choose together the right plan for you! 

I spend most of my time to grow vegetables for my family, without using any chemicals. Probably here you will taste the best “Greek Salad” you ever had! My slogan is ""YAMAS"" (to our health). I love people who smile, and I'm very happy to give as much smiles as possible :-) 

Enjoy your Greek experience with us. Hope to meet all of you soon! 
Safe Travels, 
Kim & Yannis

2813,71413966,"Ταξιδεύω απο πολύ νωρίς στη ζωή μου, έζησα 4 χρόνια στην Ν. Υόρκη στη δεκαετία του '80, είμαι δασκάλα χορού και ψυχοθεραπεύτρια. Έχω δημιουργήσει η ίδια, σχεδιάζοντας, διακοσμώντας και επιβλέποντας την ανακατασκευή κτισμάτων, όπως το στούντιό μου και το σπίτι μου.  Ξέρω έτσι τη διαδικασία της δημιουργίας και πόσο κόπο και χρήματα απαιτεί. Σέβομαι, είμαι υπεύθυνη ως προς τον χώρο  και μ' αρέσει να ζω σε όμορφο αισθητικά περιβάλλον με ενδιαφέροντες ανθρώπους. Δεν καπνίζω και προσπαθώ να ζω υγιεινά. Χρειάζομαι η κατοικία που βρίσκομαι να είναι καθαρή, να έχει τάξη αλλά και προσωπικότητα. Το σημαντικότερο όλων όμως για μένα είναι η θετική αλληλεπίδραση και η καλή επικοινωνία με τους ανθρώπους που έρχομαι σ' επαφή. Αγαπώ τις διαφορετικές κουλτούρες και εμπνέομαι απο την τέχνη, τον πολιτισμό. Είμαι αυτόνομος και συνεννοήσιμος άνθρωπος. Ζω μια γεμάτη ζωή στην πόλη μου.
Δεν μπορώ να ζω χωρίς την τέχνη, τη φύση, τις ζεστές σχέσεις, την ομορφιά, την αλλαγή και την εξέλιξη. Πηγαίνω τακτικά σε ταινίες κυρίως σινεφίλ, ακούω μουσική απο κλασική, μέχρι τζαζ, ροκ, ethnic, alternative rock, διαβάζω λογοτεχνία, ψυχολογία και ιστορία. Κάνω διαλογισμό μέσα απο την κίνηση για μένα και διδάσκοντας η ίδια-έχω εκπαιδεύσει πολύ κόσμό 27 χρόνια τώρα στην Ελλάδα και στο εξωτερικό. Θα με βρείτε σχετικά στο (Website hidden by Airbnb) Ως προς το φαγητό, χρειάζομαι η όμορφη γεύση να συνδυάζεται με υγιεινή διατροφή, προσπαθώ να μην τρώω συχνά κρέας και να αποφεύγω τα γαλακτοκομικά. Ως επισκέπτης είμαι υπεύθυνη, προσαρμόσιμη  και ξέρω να βάζω τα όρια μου όταν βλέπω πως μια κατάσταση δεν ανταποκρίνεται σε αυτό που χρειάζομαι. Ως οικοδεσπότης προσφέρω φροντίδα και φιλική επικοινωνία ώστε να νοιώσει ο άλλος άνετα. Βοηθάω τον ξένο σε αυτά που χρειάζεται και ακούω τις ανάγκες του. Του δίνω χώρο να γνωρίσει την καθημερινότητά μου ανάλογα με τη σχέση που έχω μαζί του. Ουσιαστικά κάθε φορά χρειάζεται να ""μετράω"" την απόσταση που κάνει και τους δύο να αισθάνονται όμορφα και λειτουργικά. Τα ταξίδιά μου συνήθως συνδυάζουν τη δουλειά(διδασκω στο εξωτερικό) με την απόλαυση που έχει κανείς όταν αλλάζει τόπο διαμονής, έστω και για λίγο. Έχω ταξιδέψει σε πολλές χώρες της Ευρώπης, Αμερική, και Ασία. 

Since early on in my life, I travel abroad, visiting other countries, getting familiar with their history and culture. During the 80s, I studied contemporary dance in NYC where I lived for 4 years.

I have passion for the creation of space; thus, I have renovated and got personally involved with the reconstruction and decoration of various spaces including Present Body dance/movement studio and my flat. Having all this experience, I appreciate beauty and well-being; I enjoy living amongst interesting, cultured people; the quality of inner and outer environment is very important to me. I try to live respectful to my body and the place that surrounds me. Thus, I don’t smoke, and I enjoy good communication with the people that I meet. I love the arts, being in nature; I am open to new acquaintances, relationships that offer a ground of warmth, respect and  creativity.

ENGLISH:
I am an architect who studied in Florence and  consider Italy my second home country. In 2006 I refurbished a building in ""Ampelokipoi - Athens"" and transformed it in rental furnitured apartments which offer a warm and cosy environment to Athens visitors. As I am a third generation Athenian I know many secrets of this city and am willing to share them with you. I speak good italian, english, french and some spanish. Together with my wife Evangelia we manage this airbnb apartment which was our previous personal residence. We like travels, good company and food, arts and music.
ITALIANO:
Mi sono laureato in architettura a Firenze (... nel secolo scorso!!!) e considero l' Italia la mia seconda patria. Nel 2006 ho restaurato un vecchio edificio scolastico nel quartiere di ""Ampelokipoi"" e l' ho trasformato in appartamenti ammobiliati (Evmaros Apartments) per offrire un ambiente caldo ed accogliente a chi viene a visitare Atene. Dal momento che sono nato qui conosco tantissimi segreti di questa citta' e saro' felice di condividerli con voi. Parlo bene l' italiano, l' inglese, il francese e un po' di spagnolo. Insieme a mia moglie Evangelia gestiamo questo appartamento airbnb che per tanti anni e' stata la nostra casa. Ci piace viaggiare, la buona compagnia, il buon cibo le arti e la musica.

Επειδή από τη γέννησή μου ζω σε αυτήν τη γειτονιά (Αμπελόκηποι)  γνωρίζω καλά την πόλη και θα χαρώ να μοιραστώ μαζί σας τα μυστικά της. Μιλάω καλά ιταλικά, αγγλικά, γαλλικά και λίγα ισπανικά.

3162,160618657,"Vaso‘s house is located in Ano Patissia, approximately 3 km from the center of Athens and in proximity to public transport stations (bus and metro).

Patissia is a historic district of Athens. At the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century many wealthy Athenians chose this area to built their summer houses. For this reason one sees many neoclassical houses with the distinctive architecture of this period. These neoclassical summer houses with gardens consisted the first garden district of Athens, parts of which one can still recognize to date.

Vaso’s house is located in the center of this area (Kypriadou) which is situated very close to the Center but not inside the busy tourist area.

Patission street starts from the center of Athens (it is the extension of Aiolou street which leads to Acropole) and divides Patissia in two areas. Ano Patissia (Upper side Patissia), where Vaso’s house is located, retains many of the characteristic elements of the old Athens (houses with gardens, squares, green sides). Kato Patissia (Lower side Patissia) underwent a rapid urbanization during the 1950’s and today in some parts the effects of the economical crisis are quite evident.

Ano Patissia during the 1980’s and 1990’s was a reference point for the rock stage with many of the classical rock spots still in operation, very close to Vaso’s house.

Patission street is of historical significance for Greece’s contemporary political history. The Polytechnic school and the School of Economics are located on this street, the universities from which the riot against the dictatorship commenced (in 1973).

Vaso’ s house was originally one of these summer villas and was renovated in 1987. The ground floor is built from stone and thus particularly cool during the summer months! It retains many of the characteristics of the old architectural style, with tall ceilings, spacious rooms and a lemon tree garden.

Today, a part of this library is placed in the disposal of the tenants of the apartment, who might want to rest from their tour in the city reading a beautiful book that exists in the bookshelves. It's my pleasure to know that my visitors who come from far away will read the books that we loved so much and also accompanied our life.

3194,229526838,"Kalimera, I’m Alex, and welcome to Athens! At Gaia, we encourage our guests to enjoy what the real Greece has to offer and we want to show you that the local way is the only way!

Being Greek, family and hospitality is deeply rooted within our culture, and is at the heart of everything we do here at Gaia. We want our guests to feel right at home in our wonderful city, and however long your stay, we promise to make it a truly enjoyable authentic Greek experience; come and discover what it means to live the local way!

Guests’ safety and comfort is at the top of our list, and we strive to make sure your stay at Gaia meets all your needs as a home from home - we are proud this summer to offer our guests newly renovated rooms, with optimum comfort in mind. I learnt from a young age the value of hospitality and I understand how important it is to feel at home, more than ever when you are away. Growing up with and working in hospitality, I was inspired by my love of meeting new people, making connections, and most of all, helping these people get the most out of their experiences - so much so, that I have formed a career around the business of making this happen! We want to make sure guests don’t just have a place to stay, but gain as much as they can from their visit to Athens! People come from all parts of the world to visit our amazing city as their chosen holiday destination - it’s my job (and my pleasure!) to help make their experience the best it can possibly be!

Athens to me is home; the people, the kindness shown within the community and to strangers alike - we have an amazing atmosphere here, and it’s one you won’t find anywhere else in the world. Here in Athens we like to have fun, we delight in the old and embrace the new - which you’ll see wherever you walk within the city - the beautiful meeting of Modern and Ancient Greece. A city that has it all, everything for everyone - and so much more than a visit to the Acropolis! I want to share this special connection I have with the city with others, and encourage visitors, both Greek and international, to explore the place I’m proud to call home. Let me show you my Athens! 

Psirri in particular, is the buzzing neighbourhood where you’ll find us (along with the best hangouts and eateries in Athens!) - the Gaia family is proud to be part of a community that represents the very soul of the city. Experience real Greece here; eat what the locals do, drink with us, explore our streets you haven’t read about yet, take a walk through our history, modern and ancient - and live the local way!

Since my family and I began constructing Gaia in 2016, we have worked hard to expand, and are now able to offer more options for our guests seeking independent accommodation within the heart of the city. With our guests’ needs in mind, we’re now managing premium apartments, in the perfect location, which capture the authenticity and spirit of Psyri; you’ll be able to experience the real Athens like a local, with all the amenities you need to feel at home.
 
Gaia was created by family for family - since we started out as a small hotel with only a few rooms open, people have loved staying with us because of our incredible culture of going above and beyond when it comes to hospitality - my family has always lived by this principle, and we welcome all of our guests as we do our own family - we’ll make sure you won’t leave Athens without a full stomach, a story to tell and a promise to come back and visit! We look forward to welcoming you soon!

I live in Glyfada (Athens) but I was born and raised in Montreal, Canada!..that's where my English and French come in! When I was young, I would spend my summer vacations in Greece and mostly at my village in Raches Kyparissia.

The past years I enjoy a more healthy lifestyle and nutrition. My days are pretty much the same.. I take my 20 minute run to the beach with Ruben, go biking, surfing, Sup and horse backriding.. as I'm an animal lover! I try to see my family, friends, and travel as often as I can.. Got to watch a movie at night.. 
Recently, in Raches, I discovered enjoying gardening and painting on old wood.. In fact, you will see few of ""my works"" in the house!.. 
but enough about me..  :)

As soon as we disembarked on Crete  in 2005 for the first time, this island became the shelter we have eagerly been looking for; not only as a place to spend our holidays on, but also as a genuine paradise where everything is possible. However we never abandoned neither our birth city and second Luna base, that of Athens, nor the beautiful Peloponnese and Evia island which still play an important role as the origin of our chilhood’s greatest memories and campers secrets.

After spending more than twenty years in sports management, catamaran sailing and yachting business, providing camping on the sea to adventurous travelers, we combined our love for luxurious compact motorhomes/automobiles and versatile flexible vans. Our RVs experience connected all the dots that represent our favorite destinations in one big road trip circle of partnerships and experiences. All those years we sought hidden spots & places, tried hard to find the best tips locals have to offer and eventually we combined all these campers experiences to our network of discount partners and to the greatest travel guide for campers! That was when the Hermes and his crew, designed Luna Trips RVs & Campers Road Trip Network.

While in this balsamic Moon phase, you need more nurturing time than ever before, alone or with loved ones. It’s time for long luxuriant dives into the sea, tranquil nights reading, listening to music or doing the most natural thing of all: chatting with those you admire, sharing experiences, your deepest fears and your highest dreams, preparing a meal as a token of appreciation to yourself and those around you, spending time in serenity and isolation. This LunaTrips Campers experience is as unique as the logo’s moon eclipse…

I take my hosting duties very seriously because I understand that the few days a guest stays at my place may be the only time of the year they can relax and recharge their batteries. Αncient Greeks believed that filoxenia (hospitality) was a sacred duty because the gods disguised themselves as guests and visited them in order to test their kindness. The host and the guests were united with eternal bonds of friendship which their children inherited. This is how I interact with my guests, always taking time to pay attention to individual needs and questions they may have or advice they need to get around.

Good evening World !

My name is Ilias,
I would  like to thank you first for your interest in our apartments.

I will assure you that our apartments will always be clean (because this is our priority), our prices will remain stable LOW because we understand the needs of both Greek and the foreign visitor,as well will provide you with the necessary services to have a pleasant accommodation.
In order to achieve these, I would like you to know that in this ""business activity"" of course I am NOT BY MY OWN , with me is and will be MY FAMILY and we will always fight to keep our promises.

Observation N 1:
I want to tell you please don't  send me numbers before confirmed booking  because I don't get them.
Observation N 2:
The reason I am asking for ID NUMBER is because it is a necessary procedure,anyone else who didn't ask for it probably he didn't make his work correctly. 
Observation N 3:
When you ask me for a lower price please do not overdo it.
From the platform here you are going to get the biggest discount if you close directly 1 month,so wherever the price is from the platform, it is the same and outside of it,so please do the reservation from here and we both win time and safety. 
Observation N 4:
I am always trying to provide as much information as possible about the location of the apartment and with which means of transport it is serviced and which ones are, and I beg you don't  send me messages about where the house is or how much time from the meter etc. See all the photos better and read the captions for each apartment.
Observation N 5: 
If you make a reservation on behalf of a third party, make sure that it has received all the necessary information for the property you have closed, by sending the photos with  screenshots that may not match it so that it is also in agreement that the property is covered his needs.

Finally, I wish to all of you to be healthy to be ALL ALL good and to smile to make others worry!

I am an avid art lover and an easy going person, who loves being near the city center in all towns in the world. I am sociable and being Greek I have always had a flair and natural talent on hospitality (philoxenia). I believe that travelers get to know a place when they also ""mix and interact"" with local people. I strive to get to know people from all over the world and share my interests and culture and knowledge with them. 
As a guest I would like to have a personal touch during my stay - a tip from a local. The same as a host - I strive to connect with people and also socialize with my guests  if possible, as well as give them information, and tips and share local knowledge. I love the sun and the sea and I am passionate for music, theater, the opera and the arts in general, as well as museums and ancient civilizations. My favorite travel destinations are Greece, London, Berlin and New York. My favorite book is ""The House of the Spirits"" (Isabel Allende) and my favorite movies are ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Blade Runner"". My favorite show is the ""Phantom of the Opera"" and my favourite Opera is ""AIDA"". I love Greek and Mediterranean food.

4673,46523487,"One of the main reasons I decided to get involved with the airbnb market was the positive experiences I had, over the years, being myself a customer. I came to realise how important is to built relationships through the airbnb service converting a simple stay into a personised experience that not only offers a comfortable stay but also promotes a vivid exchange of customs, experiences, education, ways of life e.t.c. 
I strive to provide an all-round service that accomodates all your needs. 

 My favourite task is to offer my guests the best  possible experience.  Over the years and having lived for so  many years abroad and in several countries, either for work commintments or at times by choice,  I gained  the ability to make people feel comfortable, respected and appreciated. 

From my experience in life as a professional and inspired from my hobby, acting, I’ve got a life motto: 'Life is full of happiness and tears; be strong, have faith, and travel as much as you can''.

I wish cooperation and I believe that success is more enjoyable when you share it with others.
I’m quite sensitive with the elderly and the children.  I believe that each one of us should have the right to  quality and enjoyment in life. I try to be supportive with those having higher demands and discreet with those needing higher privacy. I’m passionate about keeping my guests happy.
I believe that there’s no indulgence without esthetics and this applies to all aspects of one’s life. Athens and generally the region of Attica is gifted with natural beauty, harmony and unspoken esthetics manifested through its splendid landscape, light and its sea ""Saronic gulf"" with a superb coastline.

I believe that Skynest apARTment gives its guests that feeling of unforced quality and exquisite taste combined with a really homely atmosfere, satisfying even the most difficult demands.
My current big bet is to offer high quality indoor and outdoor services to our guests.
I’ll be happy to be your host.

As such, I always do my best to seek out the sides, parts and places of any destination that I perceive to be as 'local' as possible - otherwise all that is obtained is people attempting to paint a picture they think one wants to see - rather than the cultured and local experiences one is actually after.

As a general perspective, I prefer to focus on what we as members of this precious planet all share in common, rather than what sets us apart based on differences in culture, religion and our unique traditions. Respect, peace, love and prosperity to all - regardless of any specifications each of us may carry :)",within a few hours,100%,f,"['email', 'phone', 'google', 'reviews', 'jumio', 'selfie', 'government_id', 'identity_manual']",1,t,t

The 2008 crash sent me directly to Germany where I started my career in banking.

Traveling is part of my life. For many years I used to travel the world either for business or for tourism. I prefer Airbnb apartments to 4 or 5-star- hotels & resorts. That's how I know what a guest needs in order to have a pleasant stay in another town or a foreign country. It is always my pleasure to share my knowledge with you. I have graduated from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki and I speak English, French, Italian and Greek (mother tongue).
I love traveling, nice music, good food and browsing the internet.

Τα ταξίδια είναι μέρος της ζωής μου. Για πολλά χρόνια τώρα ταξιδεύω ανά τον κόσμο είτε για επαγγελματικούς λόγους είτε για διασκέδαση. Προτιμώ για τη διαμονή μου τα Airbnb διαμερίσματα από τα ξενοδοχεία ή θέρετρα 5 αστέρων. Για τον λόγο αυτό,  γνωρίζω τι χρειάζεται ένας επισκέπτης για να έχει μια ευχάριστη διαμονή σε μια άλλη πόλη ή μια ξένη χώρα. Είναι πάντα χαρά μου να μοιράζομαι μαζί σας τις γνώσεις μου.

Ever since I remember myself things change around us very rappidly. I was born in early 80’s and I had the opportunity to live the transition from traditional lifestyle to technological revolution... Nowadays we are on the edge of losing our identity! Preventing this, is something that I like living and fighting for!

In my fully renovated apartments I wanted to keep the identity of the houses, from the time they were build, and combine it with today, in order to keep alive all the good energy and experiences that I had in them during my childhood, student and university years. I wanted to maintain them all here, by improving them and healing the problems that time brings.



Taking as advantage that I am working as a Construction Civil Engineer the last 15 years, I combined my work, my love for these houses and my desire of creation, with sharing experiences and meeting new people around the world!

I am Stella "" happy traveler"" for the last forty years. We decided to do something that we love very much, through AIRBNB.
The Greek word ""ΦΙΛΟΞΕΝΙΑ=hospitality"" is of particular importance in the Greek culture. It’s a compound word from ""ΦΙΛΩ=LOVE"" and ""ΞΕΝΟΣ=GUEST "" and refers to the act of nesting and caring for a guest by the host. It was an institution for the ancient Greeks to welcome and take care of the guests at their home. They believed particularly in the idea of hospitality and regarded it as a moral duty and a sacred rule of the gods (Xenios Zeus was the protector of the guests). They offered them bath and sleep and they greeted them with gifts. The host and the guest were linked with friendly ties, which where inherited to their descendants.
This is our inheritance!

   I am Sissy, I’m fully affected by the Greek bright sun and blue sea and I love swimming and rolling in the waves.  
   When going abroad, I consider myself a traveler, not a tourist. The difference between those two is that a traveler doesn’t need to go with the mass but to explore himself. In order to do so, he needs to know that before the exploration and afterwards, there will always be a spotless house to rest, with warm bed, soft fresh linens and a comfortable kitchen. What a traveler needs is a home away from home.
By offering my places through airbnb I put my own delight in a first place. In each traveler I see myself when being abroad and think what was that missing from my own trips. For this reason, I decorated all of my places on my own and I was thrilled about the future guests. This satisfaction makes the hosting experience a hobby, and never a job.
   It is a great honor for me to receive your enjoyment when staying at my apartment. You are always welcome!

Good evening World !

My name is Stratos,
I would  like to thank you first for your interest in our apartments.

I will assure you that our apartments will always be clean (because this is our priority), our prices will remain stable LOW because we understand the needs of both Greek and the foreign visitor,as well will provide you with the necessary services to have a pleasant accommodation.
In order to achieve these, I would like you to know that in this ""business activity"" of course I am NOT BY MY OWN , with me is and will be MY FAMILY and we will always fight to keep our promises.

Observation N 1:
I want to tell you please don't  send me numbers before confirmed booking  because I don't get them.
Observation N 2:
The reason I am asking for ID NUMBER is because it is a necessary procedure,anyone else who didn't ask for it probably he didn't make his work correctly. 
Observation N 3:
When you ask me for a lower price please do not overdo it.
From the platform here you are going to get the biggest discount if you close directly 1 month,so wherever the price is from the platform, it is the same and outside of it,so please do the reservation from here and we both win time and safety. 
Observation N 4:
I am always trying to provide as much information as possible about the location of the apartment and with which means of transport it is serviced and which ones are, and I beg you don't  send me messages about where the house is or how much time from the meter etc. See all the photos better and read the captions for each apartment.
Observation N 5: 
If you make a reservation on behalf of a third party, make sure that it has received all the necessary information for the property you have closed, by sending the photos with  screenshots that may not match it so that it is also in agreement that the property is covered his needs.

Finally, I wish to all of you to be healthy to be ALL ALL good and to smile to make others worry!",within an hour,100%,t,"['email', 'phone']",1,f,t

Good evening World !

My name is Ilias,
I would  like to thank you first for your interest in our apartments.

I will assure you that our apartments will always be clean (because this is our priority), our prices will remain stable LOW because we understand the needs of both Greek and the foreign visitor,as well will provide you with the necessary services to have a pleasant accommodation.
In order to achieve these, I would like you to know that in this ""business activity"" of course I am NOT BY MY OWN , with me is and will be MY FAMILY and we will always fight to keep our promises.

Observation N 1:
I want to tell you please don't  send me numbers before confirmed booking  because I don't get them.
Observation N 2:
The reason I am asking for ID NUMBER is because it is a necessary procedure,anyone else who didn't ask for it probably he didn't make his work correctly. 
Observation N 3:
When you ask me for a lower price please do not overdo it.
From the platform here you are going to get the biggest discount if you close directly 1 month,so wherever the price is from the platform, it is the same and outside of it,so please do the reservation from here and we both win time and safety. 
Observation N 4:
I am always trying to provide as much information as possible about the location of the apartment and with which means of transport it is serviced and which ones are, and I beg you don't  send me messages about where the house is or how much time from the meter etc. See all the photos better and read the captions for each apartment.
Observation N 5: 
If you make a reservation on behalf of a third party, make sure that it has received all the necessary information for the property you have closed, by sending the photos with  screenshots that may not match it so that it is also in agreement that the property is covered his needs.

Finally, I wish to all of you to be healthy to be ALL ALL good and to smile to make others worry!",within a few hours,100%,f,"['phone', 'offline_government_id', 'government_id']",1,f,t

6351,154290820,"I was inspired by the idea of going into a luxury hotel and looking at its reception. I said this I want to do in my life what I had a vision of as a child. To highlight Greek Hospitality to our guests.

So I decided to create a hosting and management company of every kind of accommodation that would act as the host of the most successful 5-star hotel. When a customer goes to a hotel reception he can ask information about a room until what he wants about his accommodation in or out of it. Also, the reception and reservations are essentially all over the hotel.

So we set up a company that manages any kind of accommodation from apartments to villas and hotels to hotel-level quality with a hotel reception in mind.

We provide sales management, top-notch cleaning, reception, arrival and departure services, professional photography, insurance, solutions for any property owner who wants to use it for our Tourism, according to his needs.

At the same time, we give the visitor the opportunity to organize so much of his journey with transfers, excursions, car rentals, restaurants, airline tickets and anything else that every visitor wants so that we can organize Greek Hospitality and stay according to its needs and wills.

Everything about quality is quality. From accommodation to every possible external partner to work with 100% quality hosting because we want to advertise our Greece above all.

We started with 2 accommodations in Markopoulo Oropou and Heraklion Attica.

Having several suggestions from the 1st year we chose the quality we didn't do any other collaborations because we are interested in quality first and then quantity.

This also brought us the first international distinctions from international tourism giants.

We have now reached 6 having 4 extra accommodations in Kerameikos, Tinos, Aigaleo, Ampelokipoi.

By the beginning of next year, we will reach 10 without exceeding them until putting our next goals.

Our partnerships include leading companies in every industry as well as hotels throughout Greece. 

We expect you to experience the true Greek Hospitality experience at one of our accommodations.",within an hour,100%,f,"['email', 'phone']",2,t,t

We believe that our existence on this beautiful planet is not for granted. We live and act upon this earth with ethos, filotimo and meraki, Greek words that represent who we are. We feel responsible over our home, earth, our family and people all around the world. After all, earth is what we all have in common. This is why we feel the urge to protect her. We respect and value what is generously given to us, we consider everyday a new opportunity, a gift.  
So we choose to act, because we have the power, united, to make a big impact by making the right choices. Not by duty but because this is who we are, this is our lifestyle.
Thus, we collaborate with individuals and companies that create only ethically made products. Products that come from earth without taking advantage of her. Products with ethos made by people with filotimo and meraki. People we choose carefully to bring together, to become a big family, a big Eco Hub to make a big impact we will all be proud of.

A bit about me personally! I run my own business as a freelance professional, I’m a mum to my 12-year-old daughter who keeps me on my toes and then some! I was born in Germany and I have spent almost 25 years of my life in Germany in different cities. But I have called Athens home for almost 20 years now. I truly love this place and feel very, very lucky to live in Athens/Greece– it’s more than all right here!
I have been working as a conference interpreter since 1997 and I also share my Athens in personalized tours for quite some time now. I have met and worked with many different types of people, from all walks of life in all these years. I like communicating with people and as a host I love to share my passion about this amazing city, the city of Athens. There are so many stories, legends, myths, so many places to see and experience. Athens is the place to be. History, unique sights, lots of hidden gems, exceptional food experiences, the Sea, our Athens Riviera, and of course warmhearted people. 
As your bilingual host I would love to welcome you and be a part of your experience in Athens. To share my city with you. I would love to become your host and to give you lots of insights. I hope to see you soon.
